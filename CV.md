### Summary

I help organizations deploy software more often, with higher quality and fewer problems with Value Stream Mapping and DevOps.

I leverage a diverse background in DevOps, Cloud Infrastructure, Data Engineering and Analytics, in large organizations, startups, and a nonprofit.

Common challenges addressed:

- Onboard new customers faster for growing demand
- Catch quality problems in testing, not in production
- Deliver software more often
- Reduce back-and-forth communication by simplifying processes
- Reduce delays and re-work
- Waste less time
